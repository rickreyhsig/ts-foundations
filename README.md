# Action Item: Typescript Deep Dive üè∞

In this Action Item we will use `Typescript` in real-life scenarios, and understand some of the more complex concepts: `Interfaces`, `Generics` and `Union` types.

**Make sure you set aside at least 45 minutes of focused, uninterrupted work and give your best.**
-----

## Challenges:

1. **‚öôÔ∏è[COMPETENT]** Setup the `TypeScript` compiler following the instructions in [TS_SETUP](src/01_setup/TS_SETUP.md)

----

2. **üí™[PROFICIENT]** Use Advanced Types and Complete the `Rocket` launcher in [ROCKET_LAUNCH](src/02_interfaces/ROCKET_LAUNCH.md)
3. **üèã[PROFICIENT]** Use `Generics` to fetch data in [GET_PLANETS](src/03_generics/GET_PLANETS.md)


## Extra Practice

As you will use `TypeScript` for the rest of the program do not worry if you have not understood fully some concepts. We recommend that you always **learn by doing**.


However, if you feel like you need to dive deeper, we recommend using [the official Microsoft courses here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?terms=typescript). There are free, and the quality is top-notch.
